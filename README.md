# C++ Programs: Conditional Logic and Decision Making

## Overview

This document describes a set of beginner-level C++ programs focused on decision-making using `if-else` statements and `switch-case` constructs. These programs teach the core principles of condition checking and logical branching, essential for interactive and responsive applications.

## Program 1: Even or Odd Number Checker

### Purpose
To check whether the user-entered number is even or odd using conditional logic.

### Concepts Covered
- Use of `if-else` statements
- Use of modulo operator `%` to check divisibility by 2

### Logic Summary
- Accept an integer input
- Use `if-else` to check if it's divisible by 2
- Display whether the number is even or odd

### Output:
```
Enter the number: 4
The given number is even.
```

## Program 2: Vowel or Consonant Checker

### Purpose
To determine whether an entered character is a vowel or consonant.

### Concepts Covered
- Logical OR (`||`) conditions inside `if` statements
- Case-sensitive character comparison

### Logic Summary
- Take a character input
- Use `if-else` to compare it with vowels
- Print result accordingly

### Output:
```
Enter a character: u
u is a vowel.
Enter a character: j
j is a consonant.
```

## Program 3: Largest of Three Numbers

### Purpose
To find the largest number among three integers entered by the user.

### Concepts Covered
- Nested `if-else` conditions
- Use of comparison operators

### Logic Summary
- Accept three integer inputs
- Use conditional logic to compare and find the largest

### Output:
```
Enter first number: 4
Enter second number: 4
Enter third number: 5
The largest number is: 5
```

## Program 4: City Selector using Switch

### Purpose
To display the name of a city based on the number selected by the user using a `switch` statement.

### Concepts Covered
- Switch-case control flow
- Menu-based interaction
- Use of `break` and `default` cases

### Logic Summary
- Show a list of cities
- Take an integer input
- Match using `switch` and display the corresponding city

### Output:
```
1.Thimphu
2.Amsterdam
3.Copenhagen
4.Tokyo
5.Kuwait
6.Doha
7.Dubai
8.London
9.Auckland
10.Frankfurt
Enter your choice: 5
You selected Kuwait.
```

## Program 5: Basic Arithmetic Calculator

### Purpose
To perform arithmetic operations based on the operator selected by the user.

### Concepts Covered
- Switch-case logic for operator selection
- Handling division by zero
- Floating-point arithmetic

### Logic Summary
- Accept two float numbers and an operator
- Use `switch` to perform the appropriate operation
- Display the result or handle errors

### Output:
```
Enter first number: 4
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 9
```

## Conclusion

These programs demonstrate the practical use of control structures such as `if-else` and `switch-case` in C++. They allow learners to handle user input and implement branching logic to guide program behavior. This knowledge is fundamental for writing dynamic and decision-driven applications.
