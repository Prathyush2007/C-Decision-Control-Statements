# C++ Programs: Conditional Logic and Decision Making

## Introduction

This document presents a collection of fundamental C++ programs focusing on decision-making using `if-else` and `switch-case` statements. These exercises strengthen understanding of condition evaluation, logical flow, and interactive input-driven programming.

## Program 1: Even or Odd Number Detector

### Objective
To determine if an input number is even or odd using conditional checks.

### Key Concepts
- Application of `if-else` statements
- Use of the modulus operator `%` for divisibility check

### Approach
- Prompt user to input an integer
- Utilize `if-else` to check for divisibility by 2
- Print whether the number is even or odd

### Sample Output:
```
Enter the number: 4
The given number is even.
```

## Program 2: Vowel or Consonant Identifier

### Objective
To verify whether the entered character is a vowel or consonant.

### Key Concepts
- Use of logical OR (`||`) within `if` conditions
- Case-sensitive character evaluation

### Approach
- Take a character input from the user
- Employ `if-else` to compare with vowel characters
- Display the result based on comparison

### Sample Output:
```
Enter a character: u
u is a vowel.
Enter a character: j
j is a consonant.
```

## Program 3: Largest Among Three Numbers

### Objective
To identify the largest value among three integers provided by the user.

### Key Concepts
- Implementation of nested `if-else` statements
- Comparative operators for value checking

### Approach
- Gather three integer inputs from the user
- Evaluate using conditionals to find the greatest value

### Sample Output:
```
Enter first number: 4
Enter second number: 4
Enter third number: 5
The largest number is: 5
```

## Program 4: City Name Display using Switch-Case

### Objective
To display a city’s name based on a numeric selection using the `switch` construct.

### Key Concepts
- Use of `switch-case` control structure
- Menu-style user interaction
- Use of `break` and `default` cases

### Approach
- Present a numbered list of cities to the user
- Request choice as an integer input
- Use `switch` to map and display the selected city

### Sample Output:
```
1.Thimphu
2.Amsterdam
3.Copenhagen
4.Tokyo
5.Kuwait
6.Doha
7.Dubai
8.London
9.Auckland
10.Frankfurt
Enter your choice: 5
You selected Kuwait.
```

## Program 5: Simple Arithmetic Calculator

### Objective
To execute an arithmetic operation based on the user’s chosen operator.

### Key Concepts
- Operator-based `switch-case` handling
- Division by zero validation
- Floating-point arithmetic operations

### Approach
- Accept two floating-point numbers and an operator from the user
- Use `switch` to perform the chosen operation
- Output the result or show an error for invalid cases

### Sample Output:
```
Enter first number: 4
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 9
```

## Conclusion

These programs demonstrate the practical use of control structures such as `if-else` and `switch-case` in C++. They allow learners to handle user input and implement branching logic to guide program behavior. This knowledge is fundamental for writing dynamic and decision-driven applications.
